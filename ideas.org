** TODO What does AI look like in 2050s?
* Setting

   After events of the Great Extinction
   AI has advanced to be prevalent
   "The central European desert"
*** Switzerland
    Graub√ºnden, WEF
*** Birmingham

    From Valais
*** Ellie Carpenter
    Lab researcher in Birmingham
** 2020s
* Style
** General principles
   Try to teach about realistic use of AI and technology in the future
   High Tech as well as humanity -- not just gadgetry to save the day
** Potential writing styles
*** 1. Set in 2050s with flashbacks to events in 2020s
    Possible to set a series of books in the 2050s
*** 2. Multiple linear books
    Like Hangman's Daughter, follow family members through generations
    2020s, 2050s (with multiple adventures), ...?
    More opportunity to play with technology development
** Potential narrator perspectives
*** 1. 3rd person
    Can get inside multiple characters
*** 2. 1st person
    Can relate to the narrator very well
    But the narrator may change over the series of books
*** 3. 3rd person but focussed by chapter
    Like Game of Thrones, different separated characters take the main role in 
    each chapter
